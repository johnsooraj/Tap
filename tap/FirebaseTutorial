This Project Use Google Firebase for the notifications.	https://firebase.google.com/

Step 1 : We Created a new gmail id to login to firebase console
		'developer.letztap@gmail.com'
		
		Open : https://firebase.google.com/
		Singin with email and password
		Click on GO TO CONSOLE
		It will list out our projects. choose our project Eg: 'TapFCM'

Step 2 : Click Setting On 'Project Overview' Top Left Side 
		Choose Project Settings
		
Step 3 : This will open out projects setting and details view
		 NB:At the bottom of page we can delete current project
		 
Step 4 : There will be a options to add Firebase to our projects (ios, android, web)

NB: Following steps are used for web notifications.
	Android and ios will add later, Almost all are same.

Step 5 : Click on Cloud Messaging

Working Of Firebase: 
	We are creating a SERVER IN FIRBASE CONSOLE, the server key will found in Cloud Messaging Tap.
	This server will send notifications to our every client
	So On ANDROID, IOS, and WEB we are creating the receiver 
	The receiver is Registering that client to SERVER by passing 'apiKey','messagingSenderId' and other details.
	In our java project we create the http request to the FIREBASE SERVER.
	
	Http Request From Java To -> FCM Server -> FCM Client
	
	Http Request Structure(below): url 'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send'
	
	POST /fcm/send HTTP/1.1
	Host: fcm.googleapis.com
	Content-Type: application/json
	Authorization: key=AIzaSyAD5VhH8zHuJfy1FLtg5LSGZP86cr0fuZg	// This key is 'Legacy server key' in Cloud Messaging Tab
	Cache-Control: no-cache
	Postman-Token: b2b80f59-ddb0-47cf-901c-5d25f1b453c7

	{
	"to" : "/topics/hello",		// Example of Sending Notification To multiple users those subscribe 'hello', read Step 6.
	"notification":{
		"title":"postman",
		"body":"Hello World2",
		"icon":"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/letztapcyspan/profile/bigIcon/ea2c4f6c-73d4-48a6-b308-e1f9d76257dd4324412411293877221.png"
	}
	}

Step 6 : Notifications can send by 2 methods
		One is Send To a specific user with that user unique id.	// Step 7 : How to craete unique id
		Two is Send To a group of users with topic that they are subscribed // Step 8 : How to subscribe to a topic
		
Step 7 : 
		Web Notifications:
		Click on 'Add Firebase to your web app' in firebase console -> settings -> general
		NB: i am not adding code to this page, this process is very simple
	
Step 8 : 
		After creating the token, we send a POST Request to firebase for subscribe.
		with Token and Topic name.
		Eg: 'https://iid.googleapis.com/iid/v1/' + token + '/rel/topics/' + topic'
		after the successful post request the notifications can send to the user, like step 5 hhtp request
